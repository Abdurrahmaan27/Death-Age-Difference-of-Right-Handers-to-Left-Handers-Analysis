# Death-Age-Difference-of-Right-Handers-with-Left-Handers-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project investigates the claim that left-handed individuals tend to die at a younger age than right-handed individuals. By analyzing age distribution data, we aim to understand whether hand preference has a measurable impact on lifespan. Bayesian statistics are employed to calculate the probabilities of different ages at death based on whether an individual is left-handed or right-handed.

## Objectives
- Compare the death age distributions of right-handed and left-handed individuals.
- Analyze trends over time, considering the changing rates of left-handedness.
- Use Bayesian statistical methods to quantify probabilities and test the claim.
- Create visualizations to illustrate findings clearly.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python** for data analysis.
- **pandas** for data manipulation and cleaning.
- **numpy** for numerical computations and probability calculations.
- **matplotlib** for visualizing distributions and trends.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preparation:** Convert raw data into usable formats, including calculating the percentage of left-handed individuals across birth years.
2. **Exploratory Analysis:** Examine trends in left-handedness rates over time and visualize distributions.
3. **Bayesian Analysis:** Use frequency data to construct probability distributions for death ages of left- and right-handed individuals.
4. **Visualization:** Generate plots to compare death age trends, rates of left-handedness, and probability distributions.

## Key Insights
- The project explores whether there is evidence supporting the claim that left-handed people have shorter lifespans.
- Changes in the rate of left-handedness over time are taken into account to avoid misleading conclusions.
- The combination of data analysis and Bayesian statistics provides a robust framework for understanding this phenomenon.

## Prerequisites
- Knowledge of Python programming.
- Familiarity with **pandas Foundations**, **Statistical Thinking in Python**, and **Introduction to Data Visualization with Python**.
- Understanding of basic probability and Bayesian statistics concepts.
